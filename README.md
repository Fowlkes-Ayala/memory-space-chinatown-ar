# Estuary Mattercraft Template

A [Mattercraft](https://docs.zap.works/mattercraft/) template for building voice-enabled WebAR characters powered by [Estuary](https://estuary-ai.com). Drop in your own 3D model, set your API key and character ID in the Properties panel, and publish.

## Prerequisites

- [Mattercraft](https://zap.works/mattercraft/) editor 
- An [Estuary](https://app.estuary-ai.com) account with:
  - An **API key** (starts with `est_`)
  - A **character ID** (created in the Estuary Configurator)
- A 3D character model in `.glb` format (a sample model is included)

## Quick Start

1. Open this project in Mattercraft
2. Select the **EstuaryVoiceConnection** behavior on the **root Group** node
3. In the Behavior panel, set your `apiKey` and `characterId`
4. Click **Preview** to test the experience, you should be able to start speaking to your character
5. Replace `3D Models/Axiom Wisp.glb` with your own character model
6. Attach or modify **SampleCharacterAnimator** to trigger your character's animations using Estuary actions
7. Publish when ready

## Behaviors

### EstuaryVoiceConnection

The core behavior. Manages the Estuary SDK connection, voice pipeline, microphone mute, and camera capture.

**Properties panel settings:**

| Property | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `characterId` | Your Estuary character ID | `""` |
| `apiKey` | Your Estuary API key (`est_...`) | `""` |
| `playerId` | Unique identifier for the end user | `"player-1"` |
| `autoStartVoice` | Start voice automatically on connect | `true` |

**Read-only state** (available to other behaviors):

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `isConnected` | Whether the voice connection is active |
| `isSpeaking` | Whether the AI is currently speaking |
| `isListening` | Whether the user is currently speaking |
| `isMuted` | Whether the microphone is muted |

**Public methods** for programmatic control:

- `connect()` / `disconnect()` — manage connection
- `startVoice()` / `stopVoice()` — manage voice pipeline
- `toggleMute()` — toggle microphone
- `sendText(text, textOnly?)` — send a text message
- `interrupt(messageId?)` — interrupt the current response

### SampleCharacterAnimator

An example behavior demonstrating how to animate a 3D model in response to Estuary events. Replace or extend this for your own character.

**Animations:**

- **Idle bob** — gentle vertical oscillation
- **Speak pulse** — scale and emissive glow when the AI speaks
- **Swim-to-gaze** — moves toward camera during VLM capture requests
- **Follow/return** — responds to `follow_user` / `stop_following_user` character actions
- **Camera capture hide** — briefly hides during capture for clean VLM frames

All animation parameters (amplitude, speed, distances) are tunable via the Properties panel.

**Required character actions:** The sample animator listens for two character actions: `follow_user` and `stop_following_user`. You must add these actions to your character in the [Estuary Configurator](https://app.estuary-ai.com) for them to work.

## Customization

### Using Your Own 3D Model

1. Replace `3D Models/Axiom Wisp.glb` with your `.glb` file
2. Update the model reference in `Scene.zcomp` via the Mattercraft editor
3. Modify `SampleCharacterAnimator` or write a new behavior for your character's animations

### Writing Custom Behaviors

Behaviors are TypeScript classes that attach to scene nodes:

```typescript
import { Component, Behavior, ContextManager, Observable, started } from "@zcomponent/core";

/**
 * @zbehavior
 * Description of your behavior
 **/
export class MyBehavior extends Behavior<Component> {

    /**
     * Exposed in the Properties panel
     * @zui
     * @zdefault 1.0
     */
    public speed = new Observable<number>(1.0);

    constructor(contextManager: ContextManager, instance: Component, constructorProps: {}) {
        super(contextManager, instance);
        started(this.contextManager).then(() => {
            // Initialize after AR experience launches
        });
    }

    dispose() {
        // Clean up resources
        return super.dispose();
    }
}
```

Key conventions:
- Mark with `@zbehavior` JSDoc tag
- Use `Observable<T>` with `@zui` to expose properties in the editor
- Access the Three.js Object3D via `(this.instance as any).element`
- Use `started(this.contextManager)` to wait for the AR experience to launch
- Always clean up in `dispose()`

### Accessing the Estuary Client

`EstuaryVoiceConnection` exposes the client on `window.__estuaryClient`. Other behaviors can poll for it:

```typescript
const interval = setInterval(() => {
    const client = (window as any).__estuaryClient;
    if (client) {
        clearInterval(interval);
        client.on("botResponse", (response) => { /* ... */ });
        client.on("characterAction", (action) => { /* ... */ });
    }
}, 250);
```

## Features

- **Voice conversation** — real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech via LiveKit/WebSocket
- **Vision (VLM)** — character can request and process camera images. Try asking your character what it thinks about what you're looking at!
- **Persistent memory** — character can remember conversations across sessions, configurable in Estuary Configurator
- **Mute control** — built-in microphone mute button in the HTML overlay
- **Auto-reconnect** — handles connection drops gracefully
- **Character actions** — respond to structured actions from the AI (e.g., follow, stop)

## Important Notes

- **Browser requirements** — WebSocket, Web Audio API, and microphone permission. Camera access needed for VLM features.
